# CozyQuiz

https://cozyquiz.com is a website where people can enjoy thoughtfully constructed quizzes on esoteric topics not typically found on other quiz websites.

### Tech Stack

CozyQuiz was made in a [Linux](https://linux.org) environment using:

* [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) - storing the quiz data and highscores
* [Django](https://djangoproject.com) - database liason, serving REST APIs to the frontend
* [Python](https://python.org) - backend logic
* [vanilla JavaScript](https://javascript.com) - interactivity on the frontend, sending fetch requests to the backend
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - IDE/code editor
* [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - deployment


### Purpose

After making small contributions to a large codebase at my first development job, I wanted to build something from the ground up to better understand how all the parts of a full-stack web application work together. 
In particular, I gained a significantly deeper understanding of APIs, deployment, and working with database models.
